# Decisions

Non-blocking choices made while building, with the reasoning. Newest first.
If a decision here turns out to be wrong, change it and amend the entry rather
than deleting it — the reasoning is the useful part.

## Phase 0 — scaffolding

### Next.js 16, not 15

The brief specified Next.js 15. `create-next-app@latest` installs 16.3.5, which
is the current stable release and still App Router with React 19. Staying on the
latest major on a greenfield project avoids starting one major version behind on
something intended to run unattended on a free tier for years. Downgrading is a
single `npm install next@15` while the app is this small, so this is cheap to
reverse if the brief meant 15 literally.

### npm, not pnpm

The machine already has npm 10 configured and working. pnpm would save disk and
install time, but it adds a setup step, and GitHub Actions caching for npm is
one line. Not worth the friction for a solo project.

### Prettier keeps double quotes

`singleQuote: false` matches what `create-next-app` generates and what shadcn/ui
ships, so adding components later produces no reformatting churn.

### Playwright runs Chromium-only in CI

The free Actions minutes on a public repo are generous but not infinite, and
installing three browser engines on every push is the slowest step. Chromium
covers the critical path; the full browser matrix is a Phase 7 task run locally
before launch.

### Class-based dark mode from the start

`globals.css` defines dark tokens under a `.dark` class with a Tailwind v4
`@custom-variant`, rather than only `prefers-color-scheme`. next-themes drives
that class in Phase 1, and writing it this way now means no token rewrite later.

### Tokens named by role, not by colour

CSS variables are `--primary`, `--surface`, `--muted-foreground` rather than
`--teal-600`. This is what makes the light and dark themes swappable, and it is
also the seam where a future theme (or high-contrast mode) plugs in.
